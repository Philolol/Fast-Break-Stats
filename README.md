# PlayerGT
October 2017. Created using XCode 8.3 and Swift 3.
This is an iOS app that allows users to select the NBA player who's game log they would like to view. 
The app uses a tabbed interface with four tabs.
Tab 1 is the homescreen and also displays the Player's next game.
Tab 2 has the game log. Clicking on a game takes you to a detailed view of the game.
Tab 3 lists the season statistics for that player.
Tab 5 is Player's twitter feed.

The game log is updated after every game.
